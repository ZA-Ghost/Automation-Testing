#Software Testing Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository. This space showcases my hands-on experience and projects in both **Automation Testing** and **Manual Testing**. As a passionate and growing Software Tester, I build test suites, test cases, and frameworks to ensure the **functionality**, **performance**, and **quality** of software systems.
