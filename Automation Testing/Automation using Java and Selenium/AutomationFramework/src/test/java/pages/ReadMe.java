    The purpose of the pages package is to contain classes that represent different pages of the application under test.
    Each class in this package corresponds to a specific page and provides methods to interact with that page
    and retrieve information from it. This structure helps in organizing the code and making it easier to
    manage interactions with the web application during test automation.
