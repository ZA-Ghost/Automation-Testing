    The purpose of the config package is to contain classes that define configuration settings for the test automation framework.
    These settings include base URLs, timeouts, and browser configurations. By centralizing these configurations,
    it becomes easier to manage and modify them as needed without changing the core test code.

    This structure helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns, allowing for better organization and readability
    of the test automation codebase.
